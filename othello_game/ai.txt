1. Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
    Yes

2. If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
    By calculating the number of tiles with oppisite color that move can flip, and find the one move with maximum number.
3. How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
    Count the number of tiles with oppisite color that move (x, y) can flip first,
    if it's bigger than previous ones, update the next move to be (x, y).
    Loop though all the possible legal moves, find the (x, y) with maximum flipping numbers.
4. How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
    About 70 percent.
5. How would you improve it in the future?
    To predict more than one move.
